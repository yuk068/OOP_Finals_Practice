### Light practice for OOP finals

## Algorithms:

1. Sorting program using strategy pattern with Bubble sort, Insertion sort, Selection sort, Quick sort and Merge sort
2. Base converter using observer pattern (with and without BigInteger)

## Calculus:

1. Program for calculating integrals using strategy pattern with Midpoint, Simpson and Trapezoid method
2. Program for finding the root of a function using strategy pattern with Bisection, Secant and Newton Raphson method

## Data structure:

#### Devided into 2 types: with Generics implementation and without Generics implementation

1. MyList:
   - ArrayList
   - LinkedList
   - Doubly LinkedList
   - Stack
   - Queue
   - Deque
   - Priority queue

2. MySet:
   - HashSet with Chaining
   - HashSet with Open Addressing
   - TreeSet
   - LinkedHashSet

3. MyMap:
   - HashMap with OpenAddressing

## Linear algebra:

1. Matrix:
   - Basic arithmetic operations on matrices
   - Gaussian and Gauss Jordan elimination
   - Solving linear equation system

2. Vector:
   - Basic arithmetic operations on vectors
   - Magnitude, distance, dot product, scaling

## Statistics:

1. Data statistics: Interface with some analytics methods:
   - Max, Min, Mean, Median
   - Variance, Rank, etc...

2. Sample manager: sample of programs which involve reading from a csv
   - Sorting, filtering and managing data
